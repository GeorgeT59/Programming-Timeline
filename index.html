                        It was Feb. 2019 where I started taking leanring C# seriously. I chose C# because that was the programming language at work, I learned Visual Studio at college last year, and I could use C# with Unity later on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I also took my capstone class which was a simple login system in VB.NET; it would take a user's info and sign them in.

                        <br>
                        2019 is where I officially earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at YSU.

                        <br>

                        I got much better at C#; since I started learning it in 2019 I got better at LINQ methods and Regex in general.

                    <br>
                    I've also gotten much better with C# adding more LINQ and Regex to my skillset.
