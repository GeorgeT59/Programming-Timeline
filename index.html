                        It was Feb. 2019 where I started taking leanring C# seriously. I chose C# because that was the programming language at work, I learned Visual Studio at college last year, and I could use C# with Unity later on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I also took my capstone class which was a simple login system in VB.NET; it would take a user's info and sign them in.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2019 is where I officially earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at YSU.

                        This is where I got accepted into IBM's pre-apprenticeship certification program for Software Engineering - you can view my badges that I earned from it here: <a href=https://www.youracclaim.com/users/george-tabet/badges>https://www.youracclaim.com/users/george-tabet/badges</a>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Later on I did get a position as a Software Developer & IT Specialist where I learned NACHA, Wordpress, WinSCP, and some other skills.

                        I got much better at C#; since I started learning it in 2019 I got better at LINQ methods and Regex in general.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Skills Learned: </strong>More Git & Github, enough to start posting projects on Github with Git and a CLI; like this project. Also started playing with Azure.

                    <br>
